            ### Yiyun Gong's Part (B00831531)

            What features you implemented:	
            I design the text part(questions & background) of the whole page, and devide it into some parts like questions parts, result parts, background parts.

            What do you learned:
            During the group communication, I learned that devide work into some parts can really make work more easier. Everyone can decide to do the part that they are good at, 
            this decision makes member's abilities be used in the most correct way with the highest quality. 

            ### Yinfan Shao's part (B00839064)

            What features you implemented:
            Write the code of html and provide main idea of our group assignment

            What do you learned:
            When we meet some problems we can discuss and get help from my teammates, it makes me to do assignment easier. On the other hand, my teammates are all very conscientious and do their work effciently.
