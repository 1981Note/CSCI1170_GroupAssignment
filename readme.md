## The Name of the Game
Personality Test

## Description of website（Assignment 2) (Summary of the Game)
This game is a funny test game to test player's character. The test is based on the background of a holiday travel of player. Players are asked to imagine that they are enjoying their holidays on a small and beautiful island. The result of the test depends on the player’s choices for questions which they will face in the travel. There are 14 simple and small questions. Questions are about the travel plan and habits, just like questions in most similar character tests. Each questions have two options, one represents the positive character, and the one represents the negative character. It makes this test more reasonable. However, we want to this test be more “funny”. The result of test, in fact, is only the summary of the player’s decisions before. It looks like “You walk in hotel very fast, decides to have lunch in hotel…” etc. We think this unexpected result will be interesting to relax players.
